# Ethics Statement

## Scope of Use

This food delivery recommendation algorithm was sourced from the following [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/food-ordering-and-delivery-app-dataset/data). Thus it should be limited to use in NYC, use beyond the city is beyond the scope of the model.

## Potential Bias

The recommendations produced by this algorithm are directly influenced by the underlying data, which may reflect inherent biases and limitations from its collection process. Variations in geographic, cultural, and socioeconomic factors may lead to recommendations that favor certain cuisines or vendors over others.
